    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:110%"> The Akita Inu is native to the island of Honshu in the region of Akita in Japan, where it <br/>
        has remained unchanged for centuries. The Akita Inu is considered a national dog of <br/>
        Japan and is one of seven breeds designated as a Natural Monument. The breed has <br/>
        had many uses, such as police and military work, a guard dog (for the government and <br/>
        civilian), a fighting dog, a hunter of bear and deer and a sled dog. The Akita Inu is a <br/>
        versatile hunting dog, able to hunt in inclement weather. The Akita's soft mouth makes it <br/>
        possible for him to work as a waterfowl retrieval dog. The dog is considered sacred and <br/>
        a good luck charm in the country of Japan. Small statues of the Akita Inu are often given <br/>
        to new parents after babies are born as a gesture of good health and to sick people as a <br/>
        gesture of a speedy recovery.<br/>
    </p>

    <p style="text-align:center;font-size:110%">
        There are two types of Akitas, the original Japanese Akita breed and now a separate <br/>
        designation for American standard Akita's. The weights, sizes, are different and the <br/>
        American standard allows a black mask, where as the original Japanese breed standard <br/>
        does not allow for a black mask.
